# Storage and Databases

# Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, you will learn to utilize the following two different types of AWS storage options for a web application architecture:

Relation Database Storage (RDS) service
Object storage service - Simple Storage Service (S3)

# Persisting Data
Most applications need their data to persist and not be lost, which requires a database.
We don't want a database to be a single point of failure, so we'll use resources that are designed for reliability. For example, RDS for the database, and S3 for the filestore.
Relational Database Service (RDS): AWS service for creating databases.
# Choosing a database
AWS Aurora and MySQL have no additional licensing costs. Microsoft SQL Server will have additional licensing costs.
